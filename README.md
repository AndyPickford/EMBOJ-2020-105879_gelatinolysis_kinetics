# EMBOJ-2020-105879_gelatinolysis_kinetics

- This repository contains 4 folders, one for each MMP-1 variant studied.
- Each MMP-1 variant folder contains raw data (in the subfolders ending "#1", "#2" or "#3") for the triplicate assays together with corresponding macro-enabled Excel files used for curve-fitting and analysis of the SDS-PAGE gel slices, and determination of kcat/Km suing the first-order approximation.
- The "#1"/"#2"/"#3" subfolders contain further subfolders ("A", "B", "C") which contain the technical replicate images (.bmp files) of the SDS-PAGE gels and the raw intensity data for the digitised gel lanes (files "0.txt" - "120.txt").
